The UCSD Tiger Tracker
=================

The Tiger Tracker is a first-of-its-kind system that will autonomously monitor and log the behaviors of animals 
in captivity. This system will use computer vision and machine learning to collect information on the tiger’s 
behavior throughout the day and night. This information will give the animal care managers at the zoo faster feedback 
on the tiger’s well-being and give researchers a fast, robust data collection method. Given this data, researchers 
and caretakers will be able to quickly quantify how adjustments to the environments affect animals’ behaviors and 
their overall well-being.
